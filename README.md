The game is written in Kotlin, most likely using Android Studio.

It’s a match-3 puzzle game, like Candy Crush, based on the file name and likely assets in res/ or assets/.

The game logic (scoring, matching, etc.) lives inside classes.dex.

The manifest controls what activity launches first (the main menu or game screen).

Assets and resources define the theme — probably candy, gems, or fruit images.
